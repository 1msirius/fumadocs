## Booleans

Booleans represent logical values `True` or `False`. In the code cell below, `x` is set to a boolean with value `True`.

```py
x = True
print(x)
print(type(x))
```

```
True
<class 'bool'>
```

Next, `y` is set to a boolean with value `False`.

```py
y = False
print(y)
print(type(y))
```

```
False
<class 'bool'>
```

Boolean values often result from comparison operations and logical operations.

## Comparison Operations

| Operator | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `a == b` | `a` equal to `b`                 |
| `a != b` | `a` not equal to `b`             |
| `a < b`  | `a` less than `b`                |
| `a > b`  | `a` greater than `b`             |
| `a <= b` | `a` less than or equal to `b`    |
| `a >= b` | `a` greater than or equal to `b` |

```py
a = 10
b = 5

print(a == b)  # Output: False
print(a != b)  # Output: True
print(a < b)   # Output: False
print(a > b)   # Output: True
print(a <= b)  # Output: False
print(a >= b)  # Output: True
```

## Logical Operations

Booleans can be combined using logical operations: `and`, `or`, and `not`.

Logical AND (`and`): Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise returns False.

```py
x = True
y = False
result = x and y
print(result)
```

```
True
```

Logical OR (`or`): Returns True if at least one operand is True, otherwise returns False.

```py
a = True
b = False
result = a or b
print(result)
```

```
True
```

Logical NOT (`not`): Returns True if the operand is False, and vice versa.

```py
z = False
result = not z
print(result)
```

```
True
```

Example using all logical operations together

```py
x = True
y = False

# Using all logical operations together
result_combined = ((x or y) and (not x)) or (not y)
print("Combined:", result_combined)
```

```
True
```

In the above example:

- `((x or y) and (not x))` evaluates to `False` because `(x or y)` is `True` and `(not x)` is `False`.

- `(not y)` evaluates to `True`.
- The final result is `True` because `False or True` is `True`.

## Conditionals

Booleans are often used in conditional statements with `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else` keywords to control the flow of execution.

Using `if` statement:

```py
score = 75

if score >= 70:
    print("Congratulations! You have passed the exam.")
```

```
Congratulations! You have passed the exam.
```

Using `elif` (else if) statement:

```py
score = 65

if score >= 70:
    print("Congratulations! You have passed the exam.")
elif score >= 60:
    print("You have scored between 60 and 69. You can try again for a better score.")
```

```
You have scored between 60 and 69. You can try again for a better score.
```

Using `else` statement:

```py
score = 55

if score >= 70:
    print("Congratulations! You have passed the exam.")
elif score >= 60:
    print("You have scored between 60 and 69. You can try again for a better score.")
else:
    print("Unfortunately, you have failed the exam. Better luck next time.")
```

```
Unfortunately, you have failed the exam. Better luck next time.
```
