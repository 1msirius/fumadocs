## Introduction

Before we dive into Python for Machine Learning, let’s quickly look at the tools you'll use to write and run Python code. There are two main ways to work with Python: Shell and Notebook. Let’s explore each!

## Shell

### Python

```sh title="Python Shell"
(base) ➜  ~ python   # [!code highlight]
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jul  5 2023, 08:54:11) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Python shell!")
Python shell!
>>> 4 + 9
13
>>> 8 * 7
56
>>>
```

### Ipython

```sh title="IPython Shell"
(base) ➜  ~ ipython  # [!code highlight]
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jul  5 2023, 08:54:11) [Clang 14.0.6 ]
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 8.12.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

The Python Shell is the simplest way to run Python commands. Open your terminal, type python, and you’ll enter an interactive space where you can write and test code one line at a time. It’s a great way to quickly experiment or debug small snippets of code. A more advanced version is IPython, which adds features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and better debugging tools. You can install it by typing pip install ipython in your terminal.

## Notebooks

Notebooks, built on top of [IPython](#ipython), are the best way to use Python for machine learning. As we’ve seen, working in the shell can be tricky, but notebooks make it easier by combining code, visualizations, and explanations in one place.

Their interactive nature makes them ideal for experimenting, exploring data, developing models, and sharing code, which is why notebooks are widely used in the field of machine learning.

### Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a web-based interactive environment built on top of [IPython](#ipython), making it ideal for development, creating visualizations, collaboration, and sharing.

You can install Jupyter Notebook using the command `pip install notebook` and start it by running `jupyter notebook`.

This will launch a local web server, display a log of the server’s activity in the terminal, and automatically open the URL [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser, taking you to the Notebook interface.

There is also an enhanced version of Jupyter called **JupyterLab**, which provides a more flexible and powerful environment, allowing you to work with multiple notebooks, terminals, and text editors in a single, integrated workspace.

You can install it by running `pip install jupyterlab`, and start it by running `jupyter lab`.

### Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a cloud-based platform that runs directly in your browser, so there's no need for local setup.

It offers features similar to Jupyter Notebooks, with the added benefit of cloud execution, pre-installed machine learning libraries, and free access to powerful hardware like GPUs or TPUs for smaller workloads.

Due to its ease of use, flexibility, and access to more compute, many people now prefer using Colab over Jupyter.

### Kaggle Notebook

[Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code) are similar to Colab but are fully integrated with Kaggle’s datasets and competitions, making it easy to access data and participate in challenges directly from the notebook.

## Which one to use?

If you're unsure which environment to choose, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a great option. It's easy to use, offers free access to powerful hardware, and has pre-installed machine learning libraries. Most users prefer Colab for these reasons, and for the rest of the course, we'll be using Colab.
