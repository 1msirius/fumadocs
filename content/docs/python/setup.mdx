## Introduction

Before diving into Python for Machine Learning, let’s set up the tools you’ll use to write and execute your code. There are two main environments for working with Python: **Shell** and **Notebook**. Let’s explore both.

<Callout>
  Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
  [IPython](https://ipython.org/install.html) from the official docs if they're
  not already installed on your system.
</Callout>

## Shell

The Shell is the simplest way to run Python commands interactively, executing code line by line directly in your terminal.

### Python

To start the Python Shell, open your terminal and type `python`:

```sh title="Python Shell"
(base) ➜  ~ python   # [!code highlight]
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jul  5 2023, 08:54:11) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Python shell!")
Python shell!
>>> 4 + 9
13
>>>
```

### Ipython

[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is an enhanced version of the Python Shell with additional features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and better debugging tools.

To start IPython, type `ipython` in your terminal:

```sh title="IPython Shell"
(base) ➜  ~ ipython  # [!code highlight]
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jul  5 2023, 08:54:11) [Clang 14.0.6 ]
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 8.12.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: print("IPython Shell")
IPython Shell

In [2]: 3 + 39
Out[2]: 42

In [3]:
```

The Shell is excellent for quick experiments but isn’t ideal for larger, more complex projects. That’s where **Notebooks** come in.

## Notebooks

A notebook is a web-based interactive environment built on top of [IPython](#ipython). As we’ve seen, working in the shell can be tricky, but notebooks make it easier by combining code, visualizations, and explanations in one place.

### Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a local web-based notebook, ideal for development, collaboration, and sharing.

Install it with the command `pip install notebook`, then launch it using `jupyter notebook`.

This will launch a local web server, display a log of the server’s activity in the terminal, and automatically open the URL [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser, taking you to the Notebook interface.

There is also an enhanced version of Jupyter Notebook called **JupyterLab**, which provides a more flexible and powerful environment, allowing you to work with multiple notebooks, terminals, and text editors in a single, integrated workspace.

Install it with the command `pip install jupyterlab`, then launch it using `jupyter lab`.

### Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a cloud-based notebook that runs directly in your browser, offering pre-installed machine learning libraries and free access to powerful hardware like GPUs and TPUs for smaller workloads.

Due to its ease of use, flexibility, and access to more compute, many people now prefer using Colab over Jupyter.

### Kaggle Notebook

[Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code) are similar to Colab but are fully integrated with Kaggle’s datasets and competitions, making it easy to access data and participate in challenges directly from the notebook.

## Which one to use?

If you’re unsure which environment to choose, [Google Colab](#google-colab) is an best option. It’s user-friendly, provides free access to powerful hardware and comes with pre-installed machine learning libraries.

For this course, we’ll be using Colab as our primary environment.

You’re now all set up and ready to go!
